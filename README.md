This is a simple Java project I worked on for a perspective job.  The full
requirements/description can be found in CodeTestDescription.pdf, but pretty
much you create some simple shapes, and it "stacks" them two dimensionally
with the largest on the bottom, so that, looking from the top, you can
see some amount of the outline of as many objects as possible.
